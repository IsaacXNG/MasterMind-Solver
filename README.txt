CSC 172 Project 1:
	
	This project was about applied combinatorics - the number of ways to form a string of size k with n different elements.
	The wrapper implementation is MasterMinds where we had to program the codebreaker which would use an algorithm
	To solve the code. The purpose of the project was to show how algorithms can be used to solve tasks that would be 
	complicated for humans but not for computers. 

	There is only 1 class called mm.java. The main method is embedded at the bottom of the code. 
	I implemented user error catches, but of course, there are some that cannot be caught.
